The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, the Company announced the following product updates:\n\u2022\nMacBook Pro\n\u2022\nMac mini\n\u2022\niMac\n\u2022\niPad mini\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially\nimpact, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3806, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c736e5bd-621a-49c9-be30-b56b528a2cd3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c736e5bd-621a-49c9-be30-b56b528a2cd3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/AAPL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "AAPL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 437048, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 51, "source": "16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1acaf76-ba40-4b5a-91ff-2e8c973420b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/AAPL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "AAPL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 437048, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 51, "source": "16"}, "hash": "7610d9e784d782a67c51d1a3511d43254157c0450d0c58d1c5958aadf9e948f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Segment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December\u00a030, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 28,\n2024\nDecember 30,\n2023\nChange\nAmericas\n$\n52,648\u00a0\n$\n50,430\u00a0\n4\u00a0%\nEurope\n33,861\u00a0\n30,397\u00a0\n11\u00a0%\nGreater China\n18,513\u00a0\n20,819\u00a0\n(11)%\nJapan\n8,987\u00a0\n7,767\u00a0\n16\u00a0%\nRest of Asia Pacific\n10,291\u00a0\n10,162\u00a0\n1\u00a0%\nTotal net sales\n$\n124,300\u00a0\n$\n119,575\u00a0\n4\u00a0%\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of Services and iPhone.\nThe weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Americas net sales during the first quarter of 2025.\nEurope\nEurope net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of Services and iPhone.

The Commission\u2019s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate\nand promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2)\nArticle 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS.

The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior.

If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected.\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 18", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3648, "end_char_idx": 4902, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4928c003-7b65-4090-80da-fd8b06bf0d4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4928c003-7b65-4090-80da-fd8b06bf0d4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/AAPL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "AAPL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 437048, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 51, "source": "22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e6dee943-f318-4685-9e81-83a64d8e6176", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/AAPL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "AAPL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 437048, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 51, "source": "22"}, "hash": "25ea40c3bc11aaeb081ca7a1a77e624b3c31f7239b47b308924c545695b6e3c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d9cdceb-ea85-42f7-b77b-c533cec96cba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a58c9f5fdd2a5cad2dff15a87087f662eb08a5e1637daae971a481e4574b693", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Item 1A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known\nor unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d When any one or more of these risks\nmaterialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely\naffected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company\u2019s risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased\ncosts and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust; privacy, data security and data\nlocalization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership\nand infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film\nand digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign\nexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health\nand safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement\npriorities can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to\ncustomers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and\nrequiring changes to the Company\u2019s business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can\nalso create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.\nRisks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities may increase as the Company\u2019s products\nand services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The\nCompany has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the\nCompany\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to\nhave violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating\nto the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory\nrequirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the\nCompany\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes\nthe Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal\nand regulatory requirements.

For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets\nfor \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws.

Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2024, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All \ninformation provided in this release and in the attachments is as of February 4, 2025. Undue reliance should not be \nplaced on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the \ndate hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we \nuse the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change \nin constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in \nisolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with \nGAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate \nperiod-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental \ninformation regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our \nrecurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate \nmovements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management \nand investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when \nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\u2019s \ninternal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors\u2019 operating \nresults. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater \ntransparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) \nthey are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these \nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial \nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in \naccordance with GAAP.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4536, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc82e5e1-f34b-44a3-b5f3-68388fa7af9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc82e5e1-f34b-44a3-b5f3-68388fa7af9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/GOOGL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "GOOGL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 148726, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 10, "source": "3"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ddc1945f-007b-438b-9cfd-1fc76b72d109", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/GOOGL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "GOOGL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 148726, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 10, "source": "3"}, "hash": "34d0d6d61d00f60aa6faf2ae539109194a0f66d1d8b2956ad4774a6d287af1af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea8235b8-18c5-4322-a580-1e7f17b6a615", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/GOOGL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "GOOGL-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 148726, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 10, "source": "3"}, "hash": "8b6e590f55cc536ffba7a4073d2e8fd4bf3c22e0606495626002b6309a009ecd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We believe that both management \nand investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when \nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods.

This reflects 8-15% year-over-year \ngrowth, or 11-18% growth on a constant currency basis as our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 3% \nheadwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. This also reflects the effect of lapping leap \nday in the first quarter of 2024. While we are not providing a full year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect the investments we \nare making in our core business this year will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout \n2025.\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-119 billion. We expect the single largest driver of expense \ngrowth in 2025 to be infrastructure costs, driven by higher operating expenses and depreciation(1). We expect employee \ncompensation to be the second-largest factor as we add technical talent in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, \nReality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance.\nWe anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of $60-65 billion. We expect capital expenditures \ngrowth in 2025 will be driven by increased investment to support both our generative AI efforts and core business. The \nmajority of our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and \nthe U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n____________________________________\n(1) In January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in \ntheir estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of \nDecember 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately \n$2.9 billion.

In addition, these measures may be \ndifferent from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. \nWe compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these \nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial \nperformance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary \nindependent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in \noperating our business. \nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items: \nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024 \nusing the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we \nbelieve is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and \nequipment, and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two \nitems collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of \nwhether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful \nsupplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended \nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. \nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please \nsee the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5362,

ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.\nCERTAIN TERMS\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes \nboth customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, \namortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). \n\u201cDays sales outstanding\u201d is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. \u201cDays payable outstanding\u201d is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the \nperiod divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. \u201cDays of supply\u201d is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant period's deliveries and using trading days. Constant currency impacts \nare calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to \ncommon stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, \nAdjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to Tesla\u2019s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management \nbelieves that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that \npresentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial \nmetrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla\u2019s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with \nfinancial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla\u2019s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this update, including, but not limited to, statements in the \u201cOutlook\u201d section; statements relating to the development, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, \ndeliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and services; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding \nexpansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories and refinery are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions \nand management\u2019s current expectations, involve certain risks and uncertainties, and are not guarantees.

Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a \nsubstitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to adjusted net earnings per share are as follows:\nIntangible Amortization: As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the company\u2019s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion \nprovides a more useful comparison of the company\u2019s underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute \nto the Company\u2019s revenue generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings \nper share.\nSouth American Impacts: The loss on the sale of our Brazilian operations completed on February 6, 2024 is not representative of the Company\u2019s \nunderlying business performance and therefore management believes the exclusion presents a more useful comparison of the company\u2019s underlying \nbusiness performance and trends from period to period.\nDirect Response Costs - Cyberattack: Management believes the exclusion of costs incurred to investigate and remediate the attack, other direct and \nincremental costs incurred as a result of the cyberattack and incremental costs for accommodations to support care providers presents a more useful \ncomparison of the Company\u2019s underlying business performance and trends from period to period.\n6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1600, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86aca481-3e31-4fc3-9ca0-df11f7a8d3f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "86aca481-3e31-4fc3-9ca0-df11f7a8d3f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/UNH-Reports-Q1-2025-Results-Revises-Full-Year-Guidance.pdf", "file_name": "UNH-Reports-Q1-2025-Results-Revises-Full-Year-Guidance.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 318884, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 14, "source": "14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52ee0961-6e7c-440f-9cf1-7285b190ab6f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/UNH-Reports-Q1-2025-Results-Revises-Full-Year-Guidance.pdf", "file_name": "UNH-Reports-Q1-2025-Results-Revises-Full-Year-Guidance.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 318884, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 14, "source": "14"}, "hash": "c6cb55d1ecaa48261ef02930f68c5612f424001ac27162e6e9bd68ceff99edf4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "UNITEDHEALTH GROUP\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE\n(in millions, except per share data;

Business\nOur Company\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing infrastructure\ncompany with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\nOur full-stack includes the foundational CUDA programming model that runs on all NVIDIA GPUs, as well as hundreds of domain-specific software libraries,\nsoftware development kits, or SDKs, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. This deep and broad software stack accelerates the performance and\neases the deployment of NVIDIA accelerated computing for computationally intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, or AI, model training and\ninference, data analytics, scientific computing, and 3D graphics, with vertical-specific optimizations to address industries ranging from healthcare and telecom to\nautomotive and manufacturing.\nOur data-center-scale offerings are comprised of compute and networking solutions that can scale to tens of thousands of GPU-accelerated servers\ninterconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture and scale is needed for the development and deployment of modern\nAI applications.\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence,\nenabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep\nlearning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-\ndriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and\nproducts that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional coding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new content\nsuch as text, code, images, audio, video, and molecule structures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as\nproducts, services, media or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user preferences.\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we\nserve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and\nnetworking and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same\nunderlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. The large and growing number\nof developers and installed base across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $45.3 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern\ncomputing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA\nprogramming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU to a broad range of compute-intensive applications, paving the way for\nthe emergence of modern AI. In 2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on NVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet computer image recognition competition,\nmarking the \u201cBig Bang\u201d moment of AI. We introduced our first Tensor Core GPU in 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our first autonomous\ndriving system-on-chips, or SoC, in 2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking and led to the introduction\nof a new processor class \u2013 the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the past 5 years, we have built full software stacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA to\nbring AI to the world\u2019s largest industries, including NVIDIA DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, Clara for healthcare, and Omniverse for industrial digitalization;\nand introduced the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software \u2013 essentially an operating system for enterprise AI applications. In 2023, we introduced our first data center\nCPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing. With a strong engineering culture, we drive fast, yet harmonized, product and technology\ninnovations in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, networking, software and algorithms.

We have attracted talent globally through our strong employer brand and differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership\ntalent. Our workforce is 83% technical and 49% hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased focus on diversity recruiting, resulting in an increase in\nglobal female hiring in each channel. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 40% of our new hires in fiscal year 2024 coming from employee\nreferrals.\nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted development programs, mentoring and peer\ncoaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums.\nWe create learning paths focused on our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to\nthe most current content and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications.\nWe implemented a career coaching service to provide one-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility. We have implemented\nspecifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread\nreadiness for future advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain\ninsight into employee experience and provides employee-generated ideas so that we can take targeted action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive\ntool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work.

We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and\ncapacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. We may continue to\nenter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal\nyear 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very\nstrong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if\nour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions are\ncomplex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship\nand support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,\nProfessional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\nopportunities.

If we are unable to\nexecute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of\nnewly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other\ncosts or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has\nimpacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and\nhave previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our\nsupply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and\nother channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in\nresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability\nto properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production\nand we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may\nnot be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand\nor otherwise fail to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market\nshare and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability\nissues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\nIf we overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may\nnot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including\ndue to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may\nneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers\u2019 increase in prices, and we may need to\ncontinue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our\nhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may\ncontinue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total\nsupply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations,\nOmniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models.

Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or\nregulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and\nservices.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and\nreliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme\nheat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for\nour Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact\non our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our\nvendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we\nmaintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and\ncost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not\ncovered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. New or proposed regulations\nrelating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in\ngreater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes,\nincreased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, other compliance costs, as\nwell as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and\nrestrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We\nmay not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals.\nWe may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased\nlitigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns.

The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such\ncontrols to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such\nproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our\nproducts, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact\ndemand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-\nspeed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider\nrange of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are\noutside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other\nimpacted regions to \u201cdesign-out\u201d certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to\nserve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that\nour customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,\nexcessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe,\nLatin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the\ntime a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase\ninvestment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming\nrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue.

The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could\nresult in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal\nclaims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal\ndata privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on\ncovered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As\napplicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as\ntargeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and\nservices. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy\nimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by\nthe California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional\nviolation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal\nand local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products\nand services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted\nthe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of\npersons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose\ndata is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or\n4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to\nchange our business practices.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain\njurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of\npersonal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d designed for entities to validly\ntransfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the\nUnited States. Additionally, the U.K.\u2019s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K.\nextension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms\nthat may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is\nno assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States.

These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and\npractices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with\nsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant\nconsequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing\npersonal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial\ncondition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected\ntax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\ndetermining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although\nwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes\nimposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other\nadverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United\nStates, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction\nis reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of\nforeign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Pillar Two Model Rules\nannounced by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by\ncountries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries\nwith differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles,\nadjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business\ncombinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for\nstock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock\nprice may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder,\nconsumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders\nasserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency\nmining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary\ndamages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other\nremedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents.

Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nWe have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and reactively address circumstances that arise when\nunexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These include processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats. Our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard for\nInformation Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk\nmanagement and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes, and we have in place\ncybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to,\nmitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threats.\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity\nrisks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designed\nto ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors. We\nroutinely assess our high-risk suppliers\u2019 conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT), and we evaluate them for additional\ninformation, product, and physical security requirements.\nRefer to \u201cItem 1A.

The Audit Committee of the Board, or the Audit Committee, also reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company\u2019s information\nsecurity policies and practices and the internal controls regarding information security risks. The Audit Committee receives regular information security updates\nfrom management, including our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team. The Board also receives annual reports on information security\nmatters from our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team.\nOur security efforts are managed by a team of executive cybersecurity, IT, engineering, operations, and legal professionals. We have established a cross-\nfunctional leadership team, consisting of executive-level leaders, that meets regularly to review cybersecurity matters and evaluate emerging threats. With\noversight and guidance provided by the cross-functional leadership team, our information security teams refine our practices to address emerging security risks\nand changes in regulations. Our executive-level leadership team also participates in cybersecurity incident response efforts by engaging with the incident\nresponse team and helping direct the company\u2019s response to and assessment of certain cybersecurity incidents.\nWe have designated a Chief Security Officer that reports to our Senior Vice President of Software Engineering to manage our assessment and management of\nmaterial risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Chief Security Officer\u2019s cybersecurity expertise includes over 17 years of combined government and private sector\nassignments.\n31", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5337, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c51bab7-6375-4777-8501-402ca6155da5": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c51bab7-6375-4777-8501-402ca6155da5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "32"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9993002-ea1c-4a5e-a51d-7abb76e75454", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "32"}, "hash": "5171faf617f1cf2ca1607c8e108c2c8b8c21f8f179d99fba818914fa310103cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nItem 2.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, our\nConsolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\u00a0\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated\ncomputing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,\nItem 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across\nseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and\ncapacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase\ncommitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain\ncomponents. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains\nvery strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or\nimpairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments,\nwe may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These\nrisks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain,\ncreating additional supply chain complexity.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and\nsupport new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,\nProfessional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\nopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing\nlead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures\nahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products\ncould result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new\nproducts to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of\ncustomer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures\nat the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform,\nLLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or\nsupply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as\ngenerative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\n34", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5306, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5bb8d36-6439-4aa4-b550-945b626c2a7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5bb8d36-6439-4aa4-b550-945b626c2a7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "35"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e55026f-6747-4be8-9da2-67afc64657ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "35"}, "hash": "523f7e89604d9d9072ba6d7c4578c7ab6f7f1d071557135aa99ca4af0e90b3fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a2755eea-4761-4d17-9189-17cf1ee368dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5f2fd4e451ea072438521c5e6497321a6a0bade6042075c84e583f1b2d81323", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nGlobal Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong\nKong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to\nthe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,\nincluding China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,\nH800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\nWe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,\nincluding those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China market\nin small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing\nrequirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the\nlicensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the\nlicense application in a timely manner or at all.\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in\nthe USG\u2019s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the\nexport control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our\nbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the\nMiddle East.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export\ncontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.

Strong demand was driven by enterprise software and consumer internet applications, and multiple\nindustry verticals including automotive, financial services, and healthcare. Customers across industry verticals access NVIDIA AI infrastructure both through the\ncloud and on-premises. Data Center compute revenue was up 244% in the fiscal year. Networking revenue was up 133% in the fiscal year.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 15%. The increase reflects higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels and\ngrowing demand.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 1%.\nAutomotive revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was up 21%. The increase primarily reflected growth in self-driving platforms.\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating expenses increased for fiscal year 2024, driven by growth in employees and compensation increases. Fiscal year 2023 also included a $1.4 billion\nacquisition termination charge related to the proposed Arm transaction.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $47.5 billion, up 217% from fiscal year 2023. In Data Center, we launched AI inference platforms that combine our\nfull-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and NVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs and other AI workloads.\nWe introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models. As AV\nalgorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA\u2019s automotive data center processing demand to grow\nsignificantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large\ncloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers. We announced NVIDIA\nSpectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $10.4 billion, up 15% from fiscal year 2023.

Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.\nInventories\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and\nfor excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels\nand future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions,\nchanges in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and\ncustomer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer\ndemand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for\ncompetitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024\nand 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-\nparty manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months\nfor some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and\nprovide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors,\nnew product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and\njudgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,\nin part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we\noperate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements\naccordingly.\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6\u00a0billion and $1.5\u00a0billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and\ncertain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\nincome, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets\nas income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n37", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5102, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e4cf255-a4a3-492c-98b6-e86b6e16d2d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e4cf255-a4a3-492c-98b6-e86b6e16d2d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "38"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e6126734-a74b-4286-8b65-6fc8ae570d06", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "38"}, "hash": "172f654fcfe429ebb6809590ab081950ca9d57ba7d32c12f594d5864c94d4181", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Allowances\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking\ndistributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on\nthe amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific\nproducts and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals\ninclude a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting\nperiod, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.\nEstimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer\ncontract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a\nsignificant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling\nprice basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable\ncircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we\ndetermine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\nestimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test\nequipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33\u00a0million and $102\u00a0million for cost of\nrevenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135\u00a0million and net income of $114\u00a0million after tax, or\n$0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below.

Income tax as a percentage of\nincome before income tax was an expense of 12.0% for fiscal year 2024 and a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was\nresolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145 million, related to this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled positions. This benefit consists of a\nreduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of federal benefit, partially offset by additional cash tax\npayments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.\nThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax\ncredit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction,\nstock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS audit\nresolution.\nThe OECD has announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules for a new 15% global minimum tax\napplicable to large multinational corporations. Certain jurisdictions, including European Union member states and the United Kingdom, have enacted Pillar Two\nlegislation that will start to become effective for our fiscal year 2025. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and legislation on\nPillar Two and we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global implementation of these rules. Based on enacted laws, Pillar Two is not\nexpected to materially impact our effective tax rate or cash flows in the next fiscal year.

Change in value recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when\nrecognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income\nbefore taxes of $60 million and $36 million as of January\u00a028, 2024 and January\u00a029, 2023, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other\nincome (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge\ncontracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nItem\u00a08.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January\n28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2024 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5300, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "653ba5c5-3817-46da-ac5c-da32422cfac0": {"__data__": {"id_": "653ba5c5-3817-46da-ac5c-da32422cfac0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "48"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3aee467e-f660-4fdb-ae25-d78329414588", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "48"}, "hash": "018fd1be2ea28b82e0d1792f5f1fa5468f2f1dc656b89e2c79d188d351498b73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7582b342-0f36-46ac-b88f-1cd51d4d3680", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "48"}, "hash": "84476ab2e8eac0c9ac9087198c10bfb0f427150c6e2b3be1f36646022e6301d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory\nfor excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company\u2019s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of\nproducts, based on the Company\u2019s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market\nconditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Company\u2019s consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the Company\u2019s consolidated outstanding inventory\npurchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing\nprovisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and\nmarket conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions\nrelated to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess\nproduct purchase commitments, including controls over management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and\nevaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past\nresults, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose,

Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nAll references to \u201cNVIDIA,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including\nthose related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income\ntaxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, and\nother contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\nestimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to\nseven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January\u00a028, 2024 was a benefit of $33\u00a0million and $102\u00a0million for cost of revenue and operating\nexpenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135\u00a0million and net income of $114\u00a0million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and\ndiluted share.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We\ndetermine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in\nthe contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is\nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance\nobligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in\nexchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support\nand extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for\nreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing\ndevelopment funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our\npartners\u2019 activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for\npotential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n55", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4704, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04760d05-70a2-4cd2-9ce6-9e529173a428": {"__data__": {"id_": "04760d05-70a2-4cd2-9ce6-9e529173a428", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "56"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e23bec8e-3a05-4994-882e-1729622402af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "56"}, "hash": "a5f7027bcd04a7aef4acf827be7f63dc9cb42efa52ef6c8d90775f4f247cae61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the\nrevenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services\nare performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each\nproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either\nperpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are\nfrequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software\nlicenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or\nas services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided\non a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the\ncontract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but\ncertain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance\nobligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements\nindicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling\nprice basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances\nand to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\nIf a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\nProduct Warranties\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware\ncomponent failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a\nloss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,\nor RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of\ngrant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs\nand market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs\nis recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP,\nusing the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is\nexpensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and\nrevise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and\nother intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third\nparties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions\n56", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5277, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73beb9f3-25fc-408d-a073-f436ce03814b": {"__data__": {"id_": "73beb9f3-25fc-408d-a073-f436ce03814b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "57"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa677541-4c08-47ae-b21c-7e754e156f5d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "57"}, "hash": "eae4d4b7fda15d96bf6ad7847d470e0030bef5d398887b4ca12c9755ad73b2f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "70958b32-1327-4895-85e2-ba1992b0bf90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd39e35d7b1a6e96652cfb334b202fc6a09c9711954b41d21c9d2a64f3b86509", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nor other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes\navailable that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the\nloss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be\nmaterially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars\nat end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet\namounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated\nStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax\njurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary\ndifferences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available\nevidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of\ncomplex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,\nchanges in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we\nrecognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be\ndue. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to\nrecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of January\u00a028, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6\u00a0billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent\nrealization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is\ncomputed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any\nanti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be\ncash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently\nclassify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale.

Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with\nthe related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. Fair value\nof the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured\nat fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For\nderivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting\nlosses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when\nthe hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in\nearnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts\nreceivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and\nincludes certain limits on our portfolio duration.

Inventory costs consist\nprimarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We\ncharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for\nexcess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a\nnew cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in\nexcess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method\nbased on the estimated useful lives of the assets of three to seven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and\naccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases\nare amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease\nassets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing\nrate.

The income and market\nvaluation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and\ncomparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic\nfactors and the future profitability of our business.\u00a0\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under\ntechnology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a\nmethod that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably\ndetermined, using a straight-line amortization method.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and\nused is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by\nthe asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the\namount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no\nlonger be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded\nas goodwill. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently\nuncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of\nprojected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestments in Non-Affiliated Entities\nOur investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are investments\nin privately held companies.

As of January\u00a028, 2024, up to 37 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan.\nCurrently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January\u00a028, 2024, there were 147 million shares available for\nfuture grants.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined\ndate that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with\n40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C) over a four-year period,\nsubject to continued service, with 6.25% vesting quarterly.

Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $4.6\u00a0billion, which includes $3.5\u00a0billion of multi-year\ncloud service agreements, primarily to support our research and development efforts.\n72", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2671, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e03026f-e8b7-4e4e-a3b0-5ed2ca9f572c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e03026f-e8b7-4e4e-a3b0-5ed2ca9f572c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "73"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2a3c1e92-6570-488f-886b-b78da67e670a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "73"}, "hash": "ec8ec62b36af2e5068c4918d8b0d98178d1c75dd6fee261c99f2ec17fea71469", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nTotal future purchase commitments as of January\u00a028, 2024 are as follows:\nCommitments\n\u00a0\n(In\u00a0millions)\nFiscal Year:\n\u00a0\n2025\n$\n17,316\u00a0\n2026\n1,143\u00a0\n2027\n1,060\u00a0\n2028\n770\u00a0\n2029 and thereafter\n418\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n20,707\u00a0\nAccrual for Product Warranty Liabilities\nThe estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $306 million and $82 million as of January\u00a028, 2024 and January\u00a029, 2023, respectively.

The amended\ncomplaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,\nand SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand\nbetween May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including\nattorneys\u2019 fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to\ndismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\njudgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel\naffirmed in part and reversed in part the district court\u2019s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in\ndismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel\u2019s majority decision to\nreverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit for a\nstay of the mandate pending NVIDIA\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court\u2019s\n73", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3469, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f48a4975-ed30-4671-a156-07df7f93c37f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f48a4975-ed30-4671-a156-07df7f93c37f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "74"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "69a331ca-bdcd-4d78-a9a2-c98613d6d9a0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "74"}, "hash": "699748dc356d113924129703962d190c774295ba996df4a659368fbde89b967a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nresolution of the matter.

This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and\ninsider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on\nGPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of\nunspecified corporate governance measures.

It shall be binding and enforceable against\nall Covered Officers and, to the extent required by the Compensation Recovery Rules, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\nrepresentatives.\nThis Policy amends and restates the Prior Policy with respect to all Incentive Compensation that is Received by a Covered Officer on and after the Effective\nDate. The Prior Policy shall continue to apply to Incentive Compensation Received by a Covered Officer prior to the Effective Date.\nPolicy Statement | Responsibilities\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, regardless of whether or when any restated financial statements are filed, the Company must reasonably promptly\nrecover the full amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, regardless of whether the Covered Officer engaged in any misconduct and regardless of\nfault.\nFor any compensation plans or programs involving Incentive Compensation, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall include the amount\ncontributed to any notional account based on Recoverable Incentive Compensation and any earnings to date on that notional amount. For any Incentive\nCompensation that is based on stock price or TSR, where the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation\ndirectly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the\neffect of the Accounting Restatement on the applicable stock price or TSR. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable\nestimate and provide it to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 5608.\nThe Company would not be required to recover Recoverable Incentive Compensation if (I) (A) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this\nPolicy would exceed the amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, or (B) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan,\nunder which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(13) or 411(a) and regulations\nthereunder and (II) the Committee (or in the absence of a Committee, a majority of the independent members of the Board) determines that recovery would be\nimpracticable. However, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation based on expense of\nenforcement under (I)(A) of this paragraph, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Recoverable Incentive Compensation, document its\nreasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 5608.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine the timing and method for recovering Recoverable Incentive\nCompensation, provided that the recovery is undertaken reasonably promptly. The Committee may, but is not limited to, seek recovery from a Covered Officer\nfrom any or a combination of the following sources, irrespective of whether the applicable source of compensation was approved, awarded, granted, payable or\npaid to the Covered Officer prior to, on, or after the Effective Date: (i) direct repayment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation previously paid to the Covered\nOfficer; (ii) cancelling or directing the return of prior cash or equity-based awards (whether vested or unvested and whether paid or unpaid); (iii) cancelling or\noffsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards; (iv) forfeiture of any deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A;\nand (v) any other method authorized by applicable\nNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Application: Global\nDocument Name: Compensation Recovery Policy - External\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPage 1 of 5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9, "end_char_idx": 4655, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "434f2eef-03ed-42ff-8edb-9ba838e67cef": {"__data__": {"id_": "434f2eef-03ed-42ff-8edb-9ba838e67cef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "93"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ae64dc5-e0a4-466e-965c-578f7ee92a62", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/zhayiwei/Desktop/simple-financial-rag-chatbot/data/nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_name": "nvda-2024-Q4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1074533, "creation_date": "2025-04-18", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-18", "total_pages": 96, "source": "93"}, "hash": "25be6f9b991e795992b847cb50f45b88e6f104b513b792ad21f2722ed5c62124", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\nlaw or contract.
